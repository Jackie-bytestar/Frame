# Linked list framework(With detailed notes)
## `Introduction`:
This code is a simple framework written based on the various operations and functions of the linked list. The comments inside are very clear and very convenient to use.:blush::blush::blush:
## `Whisper`:There were a lot of homework on linked lists last semester, so I simply wrote such a framework for easy use.:sunny:
## `Author's Voice`:Maybe this code is not perfect yet. Suggestions are welcome. If you like it, please give a star as encouragement.:star::star::star:
